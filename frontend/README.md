A professional-grade, full-stack web application designed to streamline and automate the academic quarterly reporting process for Bhilai Institute of Technology, Durg. This portal provides a secure, role-based system for faculty to submit data, HODs to oversee their departments, and administrators to manage the entire system and derive key analytics.

✨ Key Features
This project is built with a focus on security, scalability, and user experience, incorporating a range of industry-standard features.

👨‍💻 Core Functionality & User Management
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Three distinct user roles (Faculty, HOD, Admin) with tailored permissions and dashboard views.

Dynamic Form System: A highly scalable system that dynamically generates over 40 unique data submission forms from a central configuration, adhering to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

Complete Admin Dashboard: A dedicated UI for administrators to create, edit, deactivate, and manage all user accounts and departments.

Advanced Filtering: A powerful filtering panel for administrators to sort and view submission data by academic session, department, or individual faculty member.

🛡️ Security & Onboarding
Secure User Onboarding:

Email Verification: New users must verify their email via a secure, one-time link before their account is activated.

Forced Password Change: New users are required to change their temporary, admin-provided password on their first login.

Token-Based Authentication: Secure JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication with automated token refresh for a seamless user session.

API Rate Limiting: Protects the backend from brute-force and Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks.

Data Deletion Protection: Implements on_delete=PROTECT at the database level to prevent accidental mass deletion of report data.

🚀 User Experience (UX)
Responsive Design: A modern, polished UI built with Material-UI that is fully responsive for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

Light & Dark Mode: Full support for both light and dark themes.

Client-Side Validation: Robust, real-time form validation provides instant user feedback and reduces invalid API requests.

📂 Project Structure
The repository is organized into two main directories:

/backend: Contains the Django REST Framework project, which serves the API.

/frontend: Contains the React (Vite) single-page application, which consumes the API.

🌐 API Overview
The backend exposes a set of RESTful endpoints for managing data.

Endpoint

Description

/api/token/

Authenticate a user and receive JWT tokens.

/api/register/

(Admin) Create a new user.

/api/admin/users/

(Admin) Manage all user accounts.

/api/admin/departments/

(Admin) Manage academic departments.

/api/faculty/...

Endpoints for faculty to submit report data.

/api/analytics/...

Endpoints for aggregated analytics and charts.

🚀 Getting Started
To get the project running locally, you will need to set up the backend and frontend separately.

1. Backend Setup
Navigate to the backend directory:

cd backend

Create and activate a virtual environment:

python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Set up the environment file:

Rename .env.example to .env.

Fill in your SECRET_KEY, database credentials, and email settings (EMAIL_HOST_USER, EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD).

Run database migrations:

python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate

Create a superuser:

python manage.py createsuperuser

Start the server:

python manage.py runserver

The backend API will be running at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

2. Frontend Setup
Navigate to the frontend directory:

cd frontend

Install dependencies:

npm install

Start the development server:

npm run dev

The frontend application will be running at http://localhost:5173.

📈 Usage
The application has three user roles with different capabilities:

Faculty: Can log in, view the submission dashboard, and add, edit, or delete their own report records.

HOD (Head of Department): Has all the permissions of a Faculty member, but can also view all submissions from every user within their specific department.

Admin: Has full access to the system. They can view all submissions from all departments and access the administrative dashboard to manage users and departments.
